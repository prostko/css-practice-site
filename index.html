	<p> For 2 years I <em>apprentistaged</em> (apprecticed under) a French chef who was as bothered as I was when guests in the dining room would shovel the plate I had just slaved over into their mouths without a second thought. At this he would say that 9 out of 10 people who sat for dinner service had no conception of what they were about to eat, no taste or class. They ate like animals, he said. This is for the 10%. The people with taste.</p>
