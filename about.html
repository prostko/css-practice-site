		<p> I am a former chef who cooked in some of the finest restaurants in the world. I studied french cuisine, eventually moving to France in order to pursue my education in the origination of fine cuisine. I worked in Michelin starred restaurants, restaurants considered to be the best there are, under chefs who had spent their entire lives perfecting their craft, honing their skill. Spent tens of thousands of days, hours beyond measurement, of concentrated effort and focus.</p>

		<p> A chef I worked with once told me that almost no one can truly enjoy the experience, unless they have the ability and knowledge to truly appreciate it. Like jazz to the ear of the musician. He said that only 3 percent -about 1 in 50- of the guests who sit for dinner service will truly understand, the rest simply eat like animals, for fuel. This is for the 3%.</p>
